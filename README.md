hello...world?
I'm kinda hungry :(
Why did I skip breakfast you ask?
My mouth feels supper heavy in the morning. Traditional breakfast that don't take much time to make, like cereal, tastes mushy and disgusting. The only breakfast I can eat, like eggs and bacon, take too long to make. 
Maybe I should get up early, or spend less time in the bathroom.
But I havn't fainted yet so I'll procrastinate as usual. 
Just one of life's inevitabilities -_-
